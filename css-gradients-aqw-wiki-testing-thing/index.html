<p>+ Scene: Dage slams Malgor into the ground</p>
<ul>
    <li>Dage:</li> 
    <li>And here you are,</li>
    <li>Malgor.</li>
    <li>Broken,</li> 
    <li> with no Champions</li>
    <li> in sight.</li>
      </ul>      
<p>Dage: Strange how the Avatars are helpless against you.</p> 
<p>Dage: You can intrude on their domains uninhibited, and take their powers for yourself.</p>
<p>Dage: Those feats are unheard of. Just like you. No one, not a single soul knew who you were until after the Queen's Death.</p>
<p>Dage: All of this power, but you're weak to the Avatar's mortal Champions and, ha, hope?</p>
 
<p>+ An arrow of lightning arcs across the screen, Dage is impaled through the chest with the crackling beam of lightning</p>
<p>Dage: GRRAAAAAAAAAAH!</p>
      
<!-- Malgor gradient testing block --> 
<p>Malgor: So what if I'm weak to hope? Why would that matter when there's no hope for you?</p>
<p>Malgor: Stories tend to end the same way they began.</p>
<p>Malgor: I see this as a favor to your allies and followers. A traitor will always betray again.</p>
<p>Malgor: Goodbye, you paltry leech. The power of The Beast was almost enough.</p>
<p>Malgor: But in the end, that power isn't yours.   </p>
